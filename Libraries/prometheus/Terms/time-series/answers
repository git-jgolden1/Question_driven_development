What is a pull model for time series collection? the philosophy of the server pulling data from sources as needed instead of sources automatically pushing all data to the server, which is useful for time series collection because it is done as needed over time
What is an intermediary gateway? a middle-ground network device that facilitates communication between two different networks by translating protocols and managing data flow between them
