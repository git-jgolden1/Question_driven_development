Prometheus is an open-source systems monitering and alerting toolkit.
Prometheus is a way to measure certain things in an application, which often differ widely from application to application.
Instrumentation is the use of a library in an application's code base in order to expose and update metrics about it for a Prometheus instance to scrape.
You should use prometheus when recording any purely numeric time series.
You should use prometheus when outages occur in your application and you need a system to quickly diagnose the problem.
You should use prometheus when you don't want to set up extensive infrastructure to use it.
You should use prometheus when you are not concerned about 100% accuracy in data that is detailed and complete.
Systems monitoring is continuous observation and analysis of system resources.
A label in prometheus used for is literally a monitor for systems stuff (like cpu, ram, date display, and system ip address just to name a few).
A multi-dimensional data model is a way of linking data together with multiple common themes--like a map which links an age to a name, as a 2-dimensional example, but this can be done with many dimensions in the multi-dimensional data model.
Distributed storage is basically a way for storage to be stored and used across multiple servers to store and process it.
A prometheus target is a resource or endpoint that exposes metrics for data collection.
To scrape data means to extract structured data from publicly available websites or sources (what I'm doing).
How does a prometheus target expose metrics for collection? it uses a special /metrics folder containing all available metrics.
Prometheus is a time-series data collection tool.
