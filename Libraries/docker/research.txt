Docker run
The docker run command starts a new container, executes a command inside it, and pulls an image if required. It's a combination of the docker create and docker start commands, as it creates a new container and starts it immediately. The most basic form of the command is docker run [image]. For example, docker run hello-world runs a container based on the hello-world image. If the image is already available locally, the container will be created from that image. If it's not available locally, it will be pulled from the Quay.io cloud registry. The docker run command can be customized with options and commands. Options modify the container properties, while commands are executed inside the container. To name a container, pass the --name flag to the run command. This makes it easier to identify what's running in the container and what application or service it's associated with. Containers can be viewed with docker ps (add -a option to see all containers, including those not running). Images can be views with docker images.
How do layers work when it comes to running docker commands in a dockerfile?
